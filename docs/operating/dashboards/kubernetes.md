# Kubernetes Dashboard

One of the great things about Grafana is its extensive [library of contributed dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/), which can be easily imported into your Grafana setup simply by copying the dashboard ID from the library. There are plenty to chose from for Kubernetes monitoring, but we opted for [this one](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13332-kube-state-metrics-v2/) as being the most comprehensive and relevant.

!!! Note
    Our installation of metrics and monitoring being fairly recent (early February 2023), we don't have a full month of data yet, but we have provided examples of what will be posted at the end of the month.
